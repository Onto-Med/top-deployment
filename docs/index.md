The TOP Framework enables users to model phenotypes according to the [Core Ontology of Phenotyping](https://github.com/Onto-Med/COP).
It includes a custom reasoning engine and query service for classification of individual data and searching in data repositories (e.g., Health Data Stores).
In addition, it provides functionalities for searching in medical documents by integrating [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) and [Concept Graphs](https://github.com/Onto-Med/concept-graphs).

## State of the Project
The TOP Framework is currently under active development.
We try to provide a stable and backwards-compatible version of the framework with each release.

A public demo instance is available at: https://top.imise.uni-leipzig.de

## License
The TOP Framework is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE).
