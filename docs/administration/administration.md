# Administration
{: .no_toc }

{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Getting started
Follow these instructions to set up the TOP framework:

1. Clone this repository

        git clone https://github.com/Onto-Med/top-deployment.git
        cd top-deployment
2. Copy [docker-compose.env.tpl](docker-compose.env.tpl) and modify it as needed

        cp docker-compose.env.tpl docker-compose.env
3. Log in to GitHub Container Registry with personal access token

        echo $PAT | docker login ghcr.io --username <username> --password-stdin
4. Use Docker Compose to startup the TOP Framework services

        docker compose up -d

All data will be stored in the Docker volume `top-data` (see declaration at the end of [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)).
Feel free to update this volume configuration (e.g., make it external or provide an absolute path on the host).

### Add Plugins
Plugins can be provided as JAR files (dependencies must be included too, see for example [Apache Maven Assembly Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/usage.html)).
You just have to place those JAR files in a directory and mount it to `\plugins` directory of the backend container.

```yml
services:
  backend:
    # ...
    volumes:
      - top-plugins-dir:/plugins
  volumes:
    top-plugins-dir:
      # volume settings
```

More information about backend plugins is available at https://github.com/Onto-Med/top-backend#plugins.

### Add Data Adapter Configurations
You can create data adapter configuration files and mount them into the `backend` container by modifying [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml). For a detailed specification of the configuration files, see [top-phenotypic-query](https://github.com/Onto-Med/top-phenotypic-query).

```yml
services:
  backend:
    # ...
    volumes:
      - top-data-adapter-configs:/configs
volumes:
  top-data-adapter-configs:
    # volume settings
```

### Protection with OAuth2
If you want to protect front and backend with OAuth2 authentication, you must set up a [Keycloak](https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/keycloak/) server and use an "*-auth" variant of the top-frontend image. Respective Keycloak containers are already included in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file.

You may also need to modify the configurations in `docker-compose.env.tpl`.

After starting Keycloak, log in with admin credentials and perform the following tasks:
1. Create a new realm (e.g.: "top-realm")
2. Create a new client for that realm (e.g.: "top-frontend"). Make sure to modify the URLs in the client configuration to match your TOP Frontend instance.

The TOP Frontend should now display a login button in the top right corner. If a visitor clicks on that button he will be redirected to the Keycloak login page. After a successful login he will be redirected back to the TOP Frontend.
