# Phenotype Editor
{: .no_toc }

Model and manage phenotypes.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The Phenotype Editor is used to model [phenotypes](../content-types#phenotypes) and to manage [repositories](../content-types#repositories) where phenotypes are stored.
You can also define [categories](../content-types#categories) to structure a repository and make it more accessible.
