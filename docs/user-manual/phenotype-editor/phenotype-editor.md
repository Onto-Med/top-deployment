Model and manage phenotypes.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The Phenotype Editor is used to model [phenotypes](./content-types#phenotypes) and to manage [repositories](./content-types#repositories) where phenotypes are stored.
You can also define [categories](./content-types#categories) to structure a repository and make it more accessible.
